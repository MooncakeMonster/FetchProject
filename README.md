# Fetch

Fetch is a personalised scheduler that stores all your appointment and to-do.
Most of us have the experience of having to go back and forth between friends when trying to schedule for an
outing (e.g. who is able to make it, when is the most optimal date where most, if not all, can attend). As a
personalised scheduler, Fetch will have access to the necessary data to find the most optimal date where
everyone can meet for an outing.

This app allows users to input appointment, set recurring events (birthdays, anniversary, etc.), and set alarm for
users to be able to better prepare for these upcoming event. Fetch will then consolidate
everyone's schedule, and come up with the most optimal time for everyone to meet up.
